# Gloam

**A .NET roguelike game engine with data-driven entity management and flexible rendering.**

Gloam provides a comprehensive foundation for building roguelike games with modern .NET technologies. It features a data-driven architecture where entities, tiles, and game objects are defined in JSON with schema validation, combined with a flexible rendering system that can adapt to different output targets.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Build the entire solution
dotnet build

# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Use the CLI tool (when implemented)
dotnet run --project tools/Gloam.Cli
```
